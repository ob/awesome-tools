* [wcc](https://github.com/endrazine/wcc): allows you to _unlink_ ELF binaries, generate C headers that can be used to `dlopen()` the binary and call functions in it. It cat turn statically linked binaries into relocatable objects and even includes a shell where you can load a binary and call functions from it.
